Sheep-Loop
==========

Practice problem with While and For Loops on Code School, javascript roadtrip part 2, challenge 3:

To stay on top of this explosive growth, the scientists would like a printout of how many sheep will make a new home in Death Valley.

In deathValley.js, build a while-loop that prints a message for 1 year’s worth of time. Here’s what the first line of output should look like:

There will be 16 sheep after 1 month(s)!
