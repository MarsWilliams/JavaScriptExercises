Dam-Loop
========

Practice problem with loops in Code School, javascript roadtrip part 2, challenge 7::

The Hoover Dam has 19 generators of multiple types. For simplicity, let’s say that the first 4 of these generators output 62 Megawatts, and the other 15 output 124 Megawatts. In hooverDam.js, the Dam Rangers have asked you to design a system of two loops that turns each generator on in progression, and prints the new total of Megawatts generated.

They’d like the first loop to be a while-loop handling the first 4 generators (they have not indicated why they have a preference, alas). Then, they’d like the second loop to be a for-loop that handles the other 15 generators.
